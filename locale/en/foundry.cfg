[mod-setting-name]
bzfoundry-recipe-bypass=Bypass recipes
bzfoundry-smelt=Foundry can smelt
bzfoundry-hydrocarbon=Hydrocarbon for founding

[mod-setting-description]
bzfoundry-recipe-bypass=Skip modifying these recipes (comma-separated list).
bzfoundry-smelt=If true, the foundry building can also handle raw ore smelting.
bzfoundry-hydrocarbon=Which hydrocarbon to use for founding. The foundry building is also used for coking.\nIf [color=cyan]coke[/color], a coke item and recipe is added, if needed.\nIf [color=cyan]solid fuel[/color], an early but inefficient recipe is added.\nIf [color=cyan]coal[/color], that is used.\nIf [color=cyan]none[/color] no hydrocarbon is used in founding (not recommended).
